My name is Hooman and I am a biomedical engineer by training. I have a bachelor's and master's of science in biomedical engineering from [**Linköping university**](https://liu.se/en) in Sweden. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on instrumentation of prosthetics, biomaterials and signal processing.
It was during the first year of my master's degree that I wrote a simple code for ECG qrs beat detector and realized that it actually works in practice and could identify arrhythmias. That probably was my euphoria moment. From that day on, I have been applying the skills I learned in computer science and machine learning
to healthcare related problems. I have been a [**Matlab Central Code**](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/2510422-hooman-sedghamiz) contributor since 2013 and love to share my code get feedback and learn more. I have had the chance to design algorithms for wearable medical devices and implants (e.g. Cochlear and Vagus Nerve Stimulators).
I also work on large databases from clinical trials and apply machine learning to draw meaningful conclusions. Furthermore, from 2016 to 2018 I had the chance to work on evolutionary biology and designed efficient algorithms for simulation of progression of illnesses in cells and genes.

I currently live in beautiful San Diego, CA with my love Dominika and two dogs (Tobi and Dante).
